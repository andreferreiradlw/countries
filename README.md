### Objective

Integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v2) to pull country data and display it like in the designs. Use TypeScript and React.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Sort countries by population: most -> less
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
